The current project I'm working on is an HTML assignment for The Odin Project. I've made a few HTML pages in my life, many of which were for Web Dev tutorials. This time I'm feeling more optimistic as my pace is a bit slower, I have much different and better motivation, and also I don't have to pay rent for the foreseeable future. I'll be able to demonstrate the usage of numerous HTML tags, and also novice level skill with BASH as well as VSCode. I'll be using the command line to set up the directory for the website and any related pages, and also likely to move files to and fro as needed. I'll write the actual code in VSCode and will utilize their built in boiler plate via the ! function. Further, there will likely be headings, lists, image links, paragraphs, and even some alt tags for the images.
